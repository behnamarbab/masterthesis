\section{Concluding remarks}

In this chapter, we reviewed the previous works that inspired us for the development of Waffle. We covered these topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A brief description of the previous fuzzers.
    \item The recognition of whitebox, blackbox, and greybox fuzzers.
    \item Code coverage technique and its applications in fuzz testing were explained.
    \item We briefly explained the instrumentation with LLVM and visitor functions.
    \item We dug into the state-of-the-art fuzzer, AFL, and researched its fuzzing procedure.
\end{itemize}

In the next chapter we will explore more into the modifications we applied on AFL to achieve Waffle.
