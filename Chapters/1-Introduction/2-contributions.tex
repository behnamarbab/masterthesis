\section{Summary of contributions}
\label{sec:1.2}

In this thesis, we introduce a fuzzer which searches for states of program with a high load on available resources. The main contributions of our work are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Injecting fuzzing-dependent instructions for monitoring the loads of a targeted program.
    \item An algorithm for increasing the resource usages, and as a result causing exhaustive executions.
    \item Testing our work with state-of-the-art fuzzers, and evaluate the benefit of using our fuzzer. 
\end{itemize}
