\section{Summary of contributions}
\label{sec:1.2}

In this thesis, we introduce a fuzzer which searches for states of program with a high load on available resources. The main contributions of our work are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Injecting fuzzing-dependent instructions for monitoring the execution of a targeted program, so that a run with a high resource usage is distinguishable.
    \item An algorithm for increasing the resource usages during testing of the program, which leads to the discovery of exhaustive executions.
    \item Testing our work with state-of-the-art fuzzers, and evaluate the benefit of using our fuzzer. 
\end{itemize}
