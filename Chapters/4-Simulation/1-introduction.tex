\section{Introduction}

We developed Waffle to analyze the executables, with experimental instrumentation, to enhance the performance of AFL in finding test-cases exposing vulnerabilities due to resource-exhaustion. In this chapter, we compare the performance of Waffle with state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzzers, \textbf{AFL} \cite{afl_git}, and \textbf{libfuzzer} \cite{serebryany2015libfuzzer}. To evaluate the performance of Waffle, we use \textbf{fuzzbench} \cite{metzman2020fuzzbench} comparing the fuzzers on different programs.

In the next section, we briefly describe the \textbf{fuzzbench} project, and explain how we utilize this service in this thesis. Next, we evaluate our work, and we continue with a discussion on the performance of Waffle.
